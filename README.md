Operational Research project aiming to cover a wide range of exact methods and metaheuristics to solve a FlowShop-related Optimization Problems.
Script FlowShop.py uses exact methods such as Branch and Bound to solve the flowshop optimisation problem. 
Scrip Metaheuristic.py focuses on 3 approximate methods : Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithm
