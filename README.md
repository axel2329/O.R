Operational Research project aiming to cover heuristics, exact methods, and metaheuristics to solve a FlowShop-related Optimization Problems.
Script FlowShop.py uses NEH heuristic and Branch and Bound (exact method) to solve the flowshop optimisation problem. 
Scrip Metaheuristic.py focuses on 3 metaheuristics : Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithm
